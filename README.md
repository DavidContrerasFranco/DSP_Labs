# DSP_Labs
Labs for the course Digital Signal Processing taken in Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali during the 2020-1 Semester. Each folder contains the corresponding files in Matlab for the lab and the report in Spanish (language in which the course was taken). Thess Labs were solved in collaboration between David Contreras Franco and Alejandro Ayala Gil.

## Lab 1
This lab consisted of:
- Noise reduction and SNR analysis.
- A Correlation function implementation on discrete signals.
- Analysis of solar radiation measurements.

## Lab 2
This lab consisted of:
- Discrete Fourier Transform implementation.
- Applying a DFT implementation to a rectangular pulse.
- Analysis of the effects in magnitude and phase when changing the sampling frequency.
- Implementation of algorithms to correct out of tune notes in the recording of a human voice.

The algorithms used for the "autotuner" are explained in detail in the report and on each file.

## Lab 3
This lab consisted of:
- Genrating test signals for different filters
- Make a FIR filter with the windows method.
- Use a Chebyshev filter FIR to eliminate some frequency components.
- Filter the test signals with IIR filters, created with the methods: bilinear trasnformation and impulse invariant.
